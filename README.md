## üé• Demo

The video shows a sample configuration where I use 3 workspaces and switch
between them using hotkeys.

- [x] Focus management - set hotkeys to quickly switch between apps

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

**Requirements:** macOS 14.0 or later.

Download the app from the [releases page](https://github.com/wojciech-kulik/FlashSpace/releases).

## üëâ How it works

FlashSpace allows to define virtual workspaces and assign apps to them. Each workspace is
also assigned to a specific display. When you switch to a workspace, the assigned apps are
automatically presented and all other apps from the assigned display are hidden.

The app allows switching workspaces on each display independently.

## üí¨ How to use

1. Create a workspace.
1. Assign apps to the workspace.
1. Assign the workspace to a display.
1. Define a hotkey to switch to the workspace.
1. Save the workspace.

Now you can switch to the workspace using the configured hotkey.

## üìù Notes

### Workspaces

FlashSpace doesn't manage windows, so if you switch to a workspace and call
another app that is not assigned to the workspace, it will be shown on top of
the workspace apps.

I consider this as a desired behavior, because it allows you quickly access other
apps without glitches or switching between workspaces.

This is a common issue with tiling window managers that they often cause glitches
when a small pop-up window is shown or some unexpected app is opened.

If you want to hide the new app, you can simply use the hotkey again.

### Focus

The last app on the list will be focused when switching to the workspace.

## üöß Limitations

The app is still in early development and has some limitations:

- It doesn't support individual app windows yet.
