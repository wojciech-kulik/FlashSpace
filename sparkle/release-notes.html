<h3>ðŸ¤© Features</h3>
<p>FlashSpace supports now two modes of display assignment:</p>

<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 1em">
    <strong>Static (default)</strong> - Each workspace is assigned to a specific
    display. This is perfect for users who want to have a dedicated workspace
    for each display, similar to how macOS Spaces work. This mode can be
    challenging if you use multiple displays and change their arrangement
    frequently.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dynamic</strong> - Each workspace is automatically assigned to the
    displays where its apps are located. In this mode, one workspace can be
    shown on multiple displays at the same time. This is useful for users who
    want to rearrange workspaces by moving apps between displays without
    changing the configuration. You can't show empty workspaces with this mode.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The display assignment mode can be changed in the App Settings -> Workspaces.
